In the interest of providing the LittleBigPlanet community with a reliable way of setting up custom firmware, we host a mirror of bguerville's bgtoolset. This allows users to initialize the CFW exploit for their PlayStation 3.

> **Warning**: We are not responsible nor liable for any damages, "bricks", or any other form of issues caused by direct or indirect usage of this mirror. You assume all risks by proceeding. Be smart, and *take a backup of your firmware/flash!*

You can access the bgtoolset from your PS3 [here](https://toolset.lbpunion.com), or you can simply navigate to `https://toolset.lbpunion.com/`.
